## <a id="3"></a> 3. Process Report

Clone the remote repo into a new folder on my local machine using (I did this both on my Ubuntu and Windows OS, i.e. created two local copies of the repository one on each OS.

    git clone <REPO-URL>
   

Make changes locally to README.md 

- I played around with both RStudio and gedit editors

Save your changes on your local machine 

Commit the changes to the repo

    git commit -m "Type your msg!"
   
Push the commit to the remote repo on GitHub

    git push origin master
   
Push the commit to the remote repo on GitHub

Also, I used the browser-based method to futher edit README.md followed by again commiting and pushing my changes, but this time through the github website.


#### For the R Markdown document:

Creat and edit a R Markdown document in RStudio
  - Make sure to render the output to github_document to get GitHub-flavored markdown. 
  - Install and load these two packages: gapminder and tidyverse

Play time with the gapminder data!

Commit both the [.Rmd]((hw01_gapminder.Rmd)) and [.md]((hw01_gapminder.md)) files and push them to GitHub.

Finally expand your README.md file to include this process report!
